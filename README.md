This repository contains the source code for the study titled "Computational image analysis of whole slide images predicts PD-L1 and PFS in immunotherapy-treated non-small cell lung cancer patients" The study explores the application of machine learning models to predict immunotherapy outcomes based on pathomics features extracted from whole slide images (WSIs) of tumor samples. Six machine learning models and seven feature selection methods were evaluated for their ability to predict PD-L1 expression and progression-free survival (PFS). The code supports feature extraction, model training, validation, and gene set enrichment analysis to identify immune pathways associated with treatment response. This repository is intended for researchers and clinicians interested in developing and applying predictive biomarkers for NSCLC treatment using histological image analysis.
